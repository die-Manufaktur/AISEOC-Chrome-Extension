# AI SEO Copilot - Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension that analyzes web pages for SEO issues and provides AI-powered recommendations to improve search rankings.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you need to install two things on your computer:

### 1. Node.js

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that lets you run the extension's code.

**Download and install from:** https://nodejs.org/

- Download the **LTS** (Long Term Support) version
- Run the installer and follow the prompts
- When done, restart your terminal/command prompt

**Verify installation:**
```bash
node --version
```
You should see something like `v22.15.0` (any version 18+ works)

### 2. pnpm (Package Manager)

pnpm is used to install the extension's dependencies.

**Install pnpm:**
```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

**Verify installation:**
```bash
pnpm --version
```
You should see something like `9.x.x`

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Download the Code

Clone or download this repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/ai-seo-copilot-extension.git
cd ai-seo-copilot-extension
```

Or download the ZIP file from GitHub and extract it.

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Open a terminal in the `app` folder and run:

```bash
cd app
pnpm install
```

This downloads all the required libraries. You'll see a progress bar and it may take a minute.

### Step 3: Build the Extension

Build the extension for Chrome:

```bash
pnpm build
```

This creates a `dist` folder with the built extension.

---

## Loading the Extension in Chrome

1. Open Chrome and go to: `chrome://extensions/`

2. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in the top-right corner)

3. Click **Load unpacked**

4. Navigate to the `app/dist` folder inside this project and select it

5. The AI SEO Copilot extension icon should appear in your browser toolbar

---

## Using the Extension

1. Navigate to any website you want to analyze

2. Click the AI SEO Copilot icon in your toolbar (the little robot)

3. Enter your target keyword and click **Analyze**

4. Review the SEO score and recommendations

5. For AI-powered suggestions, add your OpenAI API key in Settings

---

## Development Mode (Optional)

If you want to make changes and see them live:

```bash
cd app
pnpm dev
```

This starts a development server. The extension will update automatically when you save changes.

**Note:** When running in dev mode, you'll access the extension through the browser at `http://localhost:5173` rather than as a Chrome extension.

---

## Testing

Run the test suite to verify everything works:

```bash
cd app
pnpm test
```

You should see all tests pass (283 tests currently).

---

## Troubleshooting

### "pnpm: command not found"

Make sure you installed pnpm globally:
```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

Then close and reopen your terminal.

### "Cannot find module" errors

Try deleting `node_modules` and reinstalling:
```bash
cd app
rm -rf node_modules
pnpm install
```

### Extension not showing in Chrome

1. Make sure you ran `pnpm build`
2. Check that Developer mode is enabled in Chrome
3. Try removing and re-adding the extension

### Changes not appearing

If you made code changes, rebuild the extension:
```bash
pnpm build
```

Then go to `chrome://extensions/` and click the refresh icon on the extension.

## Getting an OpenAI API Key

For AI-powered suggestions, you need an OpenAI API key:

1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/signup
2. Create an account or sign in
3. Navigate to API Keys in your account settings
4. Create a new secret key
5. Copy the key and paste it in the extension's Settings

**Note:** OpenAI API usage has associated costs. The extension uses GPT-3.5-turbo which is inexpensive (typically fractions of a cent per request).
