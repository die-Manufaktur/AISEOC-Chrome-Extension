# WordPress Development Template

A clean `wp-content` directory structure for modern WordPress development, enhanced with Claude Code integration and WordPress-specific development tools.

## What This Template Provides

- **Clean Directory Structure**: Empty `wp-content` structure ready for theme and plugin development
- **WordPress Development Scripts**: Security scanning, performance checking, coding standards validation
- **Git Configuration**: Comprehensive `.gitignore` for WordPress development
- **Claude Code Integration**: WordPress-specific guidance in `CLAUDE.md` for AI-assisted development

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Use as wp-content Directory
```bash
# Clone or copy this template
git clone <repository-url> wp-content
cd wp-content

# Download WordPress core (one level up)
cd ..
wp core download --skip-content

# Create config and install
wp config create --dbname=your_db --dbuser=root --dbpass=password
wp core install --url=example.test --title="Your Site" --admin_user=admin --admin_password=password --admin_email=you@example.com
```

### Option 2: Develop Separately and Sync
Develop themes/plugins here and sync to your WordPress installation's `wp-content` directory.

## Directory Structure

### ⚠️ Development Structure (Root-Level Folders)

**During development, this project uses ROOT-LEVEL WordPress folders:**

```
project-root/
├── themes/              ← Themes go HERE during development
├── plugins/             ← Plugins go HERE during development
├── mu-plugins/          ← Must-use plugins go HERE during development
├── scripts/             # Development automation scripts
│   └── wordpress/       # WordPress-specific tools
│   └── figma-fse/       # Figma-to-FSE conversion scripts
├── docs/                # Documentation and planning
└── .claude/             # Claude Code configuration
```

**Why root-level?**
- Cleaner development structure (no nested wp-content)
- Easier version control
- Separation between development and deployment environments

### Deployment Structure (WordPress wp-content)

**When deploying to WordPress, files are copied to standard wp-content structure:**

```
wordpress-install/
└── wp-content/
    ├── themes/          ← Development themes/ copied here for testing
    ├── plugins/         ← Development plugins/ copied here for testing
    ├── mu-plugins/      ← Development mu-plugins/ copied here for testing
    ├── uploads/         # Media files (gitignored)
    ├── languages/       # Translation files
    └── upgrade/         # WordPress upgrade files (gitignored)
```

**NEVER create files in `wp-content/` during development.** Use root-level `themes/`, `plugins/`, `mu-plugins/` folders.

## WordPress Development Tools

### Security & Quality Scripts

```bash
# Set up PHP CodeSniffer with WordPress standards
./scripts/wordpress/setup-phpcs.sh

# Check WordPress coding standards
./scripts/wordpress/check-coding-standards.sh [path]

# Run security scan
./scripts/wordpress/security-scan.sh [path]

# Check performance
./scripts/wordpress/check-performance.sh [path]
```
