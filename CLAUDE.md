# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a **Claude Code-integrated React app development framework** providing specialized agents, skills, scripts, and a Figma-to-React conversion pipeline.

The framework is designed for:
- Framework-agnostic React app development (Next.js, Vite, Remix)
- Figma-to-React component conversion with Tailwind CSS
- Comprehensive testing (Vitest, React Testing Library, Playwright, Storybook)
- Full product lifecycle support (engineering, design, testing, marketing, operations)

pnpm dev                  # Start dev server (port 3000)
pnpm build                # Production build
pnpm start                # Start production server

# Vite
pnpm dev                  # Start dev server (port 5173)
pnpm build                # Production build
pnpm preview              # Preview production build
```

### Testing
```bash
pnpm vitest               # Run tests in watch mode
pnpm vitest run           # Run tests once
pnpm vitest run --coverage # Run with coverage report
pnpm storybook            # Start Storybook dev server
pnpm build-storybook      # Build Storybook static site
```

### Code Quality
```bash
pnpm eslint .             # Run ESLint
pnpm eslint . --fix       # Auto-fix ESLint issues
pnpm prettier --check .   # Check formatting
pnpm prettier --write .   # Fix formatting
pnpm tsc --noEmit         # Type check without emitting
```

### Figma-to-React Pipeline

**Single command:** `/build-from-figma <Figma URL>`

Autonomous 7-phase pipeline that converts a Figma design into a working, tested React app:

```
/build-from-figma https://figma.com/file/abc123

  [1] INTAKE      → figma-intake skill → build-spec.json
  [2] TOKEN LOCK  → design-token-lock skill → design-tokens.lock.json
  [3] TDD         → tdd-from-figma skill → failing tests (Red)
  [4] BUILD       → figma-to-react-workflow → components pass tests (Green)
  [5] VISUAL QA   → Chrome DevTools + Figma screenshots → max 3 fix iterations
  [6] QUALITY     → vitest + tsc + build + verify-tokens + Lighthouse
  [7] REPORT      → .claude/visual-qa/build-report.md
```

**Key artifacts:**
- `design-tokens.lock.json` — Single source of truth for all design values
- `build-spec.json` — Machine-readable build plan (no re-asking questions)
- `verify-tokens.sh` — Catches hardcoded values and token drift

**Features:**
- Design token extraction with lockfile enforcement
- TDD: tests written before components, using exact Figma values
- Automated visual comparison loop (3 iterations max)
- Quality gate: 80%+ coverage, TypeScript, Lighthouse audit
- Resumable: TodoWrite tracks progress across interrupted sessions

**Documentation:** `docs/figma-to-react/README.md`

## React Development Standards

### TypeScript
- Strict mode enabled
- No `any` types - use proper interfaces and generics
- Export prop interfaces alongside components
- Use discriminated unions for complex prop patterns

### Component Patterns
- Functional components only (no class components)
- Custom hooks for reusable logic
- Composition over inheritance
- Props interface for every component
- `children` and `className` passthrough where appropriate

### Tailwind CSS
- Utility-first styling
- Design tokens via Tailwind config (not hardcoded values)
- Responsive with mobile-first breakpoints (sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl)
- Use `cn()` utility for conditional classes (clsx + tailwind-merge)

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit tests** (Vitest): Pure functions, custom hooks, utilities
- **Component tests** (RTL): User interactions, rendering, accessibility
- **Visual tests** (Storybook): Component states, responsive variants
- **E2E tests** (Playwright): Critical user flows, cross-browser

### Accessibility
- WCAG 2.1 AA minimum
- Semantic HTML (landmarks, headings hierarchy)
- ARIA attributes on interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Color contrast 4.5:1 minimum

### Code Quality
- ESLint with React, TypeScript, and jsx-a11y plugins
- Prettier for formatting
- 2-space indentation (JS/TS/CSS/JSON)

### Development Workflow with Claude Code

**1. Feature Development**
```bash
# Start feature branch
git checkout -b feature/hero-component

# Develop with Claude Code
# - frontend-developer agent for React work
# - test-writer-fixer agent for tests
# - ui-designer agent for design decisions

# Commit with structure
/commit
```

**2. Code Quality**
```bash
./scripts/lint-and-format.sh
./scripts/check-types.sh
./scripts/run-tests.sh
./scripts/check-accessibility.sh
```

**3. Figma-to-React Conversion**
```
User: "Convert this Figma design to React components"
      [Provide Figma URL]

Claude: [Uses figma-react-converter agent]
        → Extracts design tokens
        → Generates Tailwind config + React components
        → Runs visual QA verification
```

**4. Using Custom Agents**
```
User: "Help me optimize app performance"
Claude: [Uses performance-benchmarker agent]

User: "Build a hero component"
Claude: [Uses frontend-developer agent]

User: "Write tests for my auth hook"
Claude: [Uses test-writer-fixer agent]
```
