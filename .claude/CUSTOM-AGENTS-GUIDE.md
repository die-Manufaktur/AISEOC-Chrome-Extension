## How Agents Work

Agents are invoked through Claude Code's Task tool. They are automatically selected based on task context:

```
User: "Help me optimize this component's rendering"
Claude: [Uses performance-benchmarker agent]

User: "Convert this Figma design to React"
Claude: [Uses figma-react-converter agent]

User: "Write tests for the auth hook"
Claude: [Uses test-writer-fixer agent]
```

You can also request a specific agent:
```
User: "Use the accessibility-auditor agent to check this page"
```
